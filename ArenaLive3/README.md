# ArenaLive3 Unit Frame Library
This subdirectory includes all basic unit frame component handlers, i.e.
all code that handles basic unit frame behaviour.

# Deprecated Note
Please note that this library is DEPRECATED and is going to be replaced in
the future. Therefore, it is not developed actively anymore, but it is still
possible to add pull requests to fix stuff that is currently broken in Legion.
